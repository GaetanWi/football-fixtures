# football-fixtures

This project is one I use to show off and explain VueJS (v2) implementation with Typescript. 

This is a pretty simple project that I use as a support through the different possibilities VueJS offer out of the box. 

That is to say:
- Project architecture
- Components handling
- Data binding
- Routing 
- Calling APIs (with Axios)

`git clone https://github.com/GaetanWi/football-fixtures.git`
